# tictactoe-machine

The ant build file (build.xml) can be used to build and run the TicTacToe excercise, using the following ant targets: 

  > ant compile
  > ant jar
  > ant run

The "full" ant target will do it all, and is also the default, so: 

  > ant full 

or simply: 

  > ant

A data file containing bad moves is saved in the directory where the program is run from, as tttVerbose.log.
